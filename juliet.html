<u><font size="+3"><font color="#00008B">Scene one: Romeo is beneath Juliet's balcony shouting at her</font color="#00008B"><p></u>

<font color="#0000FF"> Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Oi! Juliet (No answer) I know you are up there ( a pause)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> What?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">You sent another one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Another one what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Another one of your stupid love notes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">I keep telling you there is no way on Earth I would send you a love note you moron<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Well it is signed in your name<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">( A big sigh) It is my daft mother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Your mother's name is not Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Of course it isn't you idiot. She is sending them pretending they are coming from me.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Why?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Because for some crazy reason she wants me to marry you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Ha! No chance<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Exactly. I would rather marry Friar Lawrence's Donkey than you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">I don't think even the donkey would have you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> So little you know, there are men all over Verona that would give their right arm to be my husband<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Well I am not one of them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Good<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Well, tell your mother to stop sending those stupid love notes<p>
(Mercutio arrives)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Hey! Wassup bro?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Hi mate, Juliet keeps sending me stupid love notes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> How many times do I have to tell you, I did not send them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Do you fancy her then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> No I most certainly do not! <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Hey Juliet, will you send me one ha ha<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">You must be joking, you are Even less likely to get one than Romeo<p>
( The nurse appears on the balcony with Juliet)<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">What on Earth is all this din, you will wake the whole neighbourhood<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">It is that idiot Romeo again, please tell him to go away Nursey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Oh my dear, my dear, you know your mother would so like you to marry him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">No way would I marry her<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercurio:</font color="#00008B"> Errr, I'm available<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">I know why my mother wants me to marry him. We are the two richest family's in Verona and she thinks if we marry they will be even richer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Oh I am sure that isn't the reason.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Oh yes it is, and my mother thinks the same<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Juliet dear, Romeo is such a nice lad<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> And to be honest Romeo, she is a bit of alright<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">I think I have made it very, very clear there is no way I am going to marry Romeo<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Don't be too hasty with that decision my dear, you do need to marry soon. After all you are nearly fifteen, you don't want to get left on the shelf<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Are you sure you couldn't give it a go Romeo?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Give it a go! We are talking about a lifelong marriage here, not a game of pool at the tavern<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Only trying to help.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Are you going to stand under my balcony all day? You are making the street look untidy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">I wouldn't be in the street if you hadn't sent those notes<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">For the very last time you idiot, I did not send them<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Can you at least try to be friends? That would be a start<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> I have plenty of friends and I don't need someone that makes the street look untidy as another one<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> (quietly) What am I going to do Mercutio? Her mother and my mother are insisting that we marry and neither of us wants to do that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Hmm I can see that is a bit of a pickle<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">I feel like running away. Far, far away from Verona<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">You can't do that mate. We'd be one short in the pool team.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">If you two don't soon shift I will be emptying this bucket over you – And I can tell you it is not just plain water in it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Ok, ok we're going<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> And quickly too<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Come on Mercutio, let's go to the tavern<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">I'm right behind you my friend<p>

Scene Two: Juliet's Bedroom<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">Do come away from that balcony my dear. It is very common to be howling over it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> That awful Romeo was shouting up at me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Oh it was Romeo! That is different then. Did you invite him in for tea?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">NO! I must certainly did not<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">But why? He is such a charming young boy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> I think Juliet may disagree with that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Absolutely Nursey.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Nursey knows best<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> I do wish you could be friends with him Julia<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> It is Juliet mother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Who's Juliet?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet.</font color="#00008B"> (Angrily) I am!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">You called her Julia Madam, and her name is Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Yes, yes of course. I meant Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> And will you please stop sending those letters to Romeo pretending they are from me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> (Indignant) I have sent no letters<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B">You did Madam, you asked me to post them for you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">(quietly) Shut up Nursey.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">And according to him they were sordid love letters<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">I don't think he said anything about them being sordid my dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> (quietly) Shut up Nursey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> They were certainly not love letters, if I sent them at all, which I didn't. They were just invitations to supper.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Can I please make this clear mother. I do not love Romeo, in fact, I don't even like him. I would rather he were never invited to lunch, dinner, supper or even breakfast. I will never, ever marry him to please you or anyone else, and if you ever send him another letter pretending it was from me I shall scream and scream and scream till I am sick<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Julia my dear, grow up you are behaving like a fourteen year old<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">For your information mother – I AM fourteen. And for the last time – My name is Juliet, not Julia<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> She is right there Madam, it is Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet and Juliet: </font color="#00008B">(loudly) Shut up Nursey!<p>

Scene Three. The Tavern<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Hello Lads, what can I get you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Friar Lawrence! What are you doing working behind the bar?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Willie thought there were two many people already in this story so he made me double up as a barman<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Well, it's nice to see you Friar can we have two pints of mead.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> And two packs of pork scratchings please<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">I can do two pints of mead but I am afraid pork scratchings haven't been invented yet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">I thought I saw some on the beer stall at the bazaar<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">No, that is Benvolio's Dandruff<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Ok, fair enough, just the mead then<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Thou doest look troubled Romeo, what ails thee?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">What??<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> He says your face is like a donkey's rear end, wassup<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Oh, I see. My mother wants me to marry Juliet and Juliet's mother wants me to marry Juliet and neither of us wants to<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> A bit of a pickle I said<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Yes it could be. I can see why they want it though. It would make them the richest and most powerful family in Verona.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Well I don't give two hoots about that. I'll marry who I want to marry, not who I am told to<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> It may not be that easy if the two families insist on it.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Mercutio is right<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> What am I to do then because I am definitely not going to marry Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">I think she is gorgeous<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">It's not all about looks Mercutio. Juliet is a spoiled little brat who thinks of nobody but herself. She can be mean, spiteful and argumentative. I don't want to live the rest of my life with someone like that.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> She is rich though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Good point Mercutio<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Money, money, money. Is that all people think about?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Most of the time, yes.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Well I don't, there are more important things in life than money.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Not many though<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">(thoughtfully) Hmmm, I may have an idea that will help...........<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">What! What! Tell me what is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Oh it's probably a bad idea, silly of me to mention it really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Well you have mentioned it now, so tell us what it is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">No, no it was quite a ridiculous idea really<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> For goodness sake Friar, tell us what it is. I am desperate. I'd try almost anything.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> It probably wouldn't work anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Could be worth a try though.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Yes anything, Anything is worth a try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Ok, ok if you really want to know. This is what I suggest...............<p>

Scene Four. The Capulets Dining Room<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">It would have been so nice to have had Romeo here for dinner<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">No it wouldn't<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">I am not sure he would have come even if he was invited<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Which if I have anything to do with it, he won't be<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">You should have more respect Julia for what what your father and I would like<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">(almost to herself) I look quizzically around the room for this mysterious person called Julia. Perhaps she is hiding behind the curtains. Or maybe under the table. Let me take a look. Hmm no, she isn't there. (louder) Julia, Julia come out from wherever you are. Mother would like to speak to you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">What on Earth are you doing?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> I am looking for the mysterious Julia<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">Have you gone quite mad?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet.</font color="#00008B"> Indeed not, I am as sane as the next person – Oh no, the next person is you mother.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">You called her Julia again madam when her name is actually Juliet.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> A simple mistake. No need to write a play about it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">I sometimes wonder why you called me Juliet when you seem to much prefer calling me Julia<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> It wasn't my idea it was your fathers. I couldn't be bothered to think of a name for you.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Maybe I should marry Romeo, at least he knows my name<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">You have changed your tune Miss Juliet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">It was a joke Nursey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Well it wasn't a funny joke. And I am telling you now my girl your father is very insistent on you marrying Romeo. Your father will not put up with your silliness like I do. And you haven't eaten your vegetables my dear. If you don't eat your greens you won't get curly hair<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> I have curly hair mother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">Oh yes, so you have. I hadn't noticed. Well if you have finished eating perhaps it is your bedtime<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Yes I suppose it is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Come on then my lovely, Lets get you ready<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Lead the way Nursey and I'll follow. Goodnight Mother<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet: </font color="#00008B">Goodnight Julia,  err sorry not julia. What was it again?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">It doesn't really matter mother, goodnight<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Come on dear, up the stairs<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">I am not five years old Nursey, I know how to climb the stairs<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Of course you do my darling, I just like to be sure<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Is there anything you can do Nursey to stop this marriage with Romeo<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Well my dear, it isn't really my place to interfere<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> I would never ever tell mother if you help<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Well I really don't know, Maybe there is someone that can help<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Really?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Well, I am not sure but maybe<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">(excitedly) Tell me Nursey, please tell me<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Come in the bedroom dear, sit on the bed and I will explain<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Oh yes, please do<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Well let me say right away that I am sure there is nothing I can do personally<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Ok but you know someone who can?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Maybe. But don't get too excited till I speak with him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet: </font color="#00008B">Ok but who is it?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">A very old friend of mine called Friar Lawrence. He is a very learned and wise man. If there is anyone in Verona that can help with this he will be the one.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> How could he help then?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> I don't really. I suppose if I did I would be as wise as he is<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Yes I suppose so. So when will you see him?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">I will sneak out tonight when you are in bed and explain the problem to him<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Oh thank you so much Nursey, come here and give me a hug<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Ohh my sweet little angel.  Her's a big hug. Now you get into bed and get some sleep and I will see what I can do.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Juliet:</font color="#00008B"> Thank you so much, nighty night Nursey<p>

Scene Five. The Tavern<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Now this plan may be a little dangerous but it may work<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Please, tell me more<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">I am intrigued.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Ok, come a little coser and let me explain. You know I have a very keen interest in apothecary?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Of course, it is common knowledge<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">An we know you cure sick people<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Very true ( A little thoughtful now) To be honest though – sometimes I seem to make them sicker<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Never mind that, what is the plan?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence. </font color="#00008B">Well I have this potion that would make you seem dead<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> I know you are desperate Romeo but do you really want to be dead?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">He won't be dead, it will just seem like it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Ok, so it will seem like I am dead but how will that help?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Your mother and father will think you are dead and they will be so distraught and upset, they will have to think about a funeral and things like that, both will be broken hearted<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> But how will that help?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">The potion lasts about four hours, then you come back to life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Then what?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Don't you see? <p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">(puzzled) No<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> I can't see it either<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar: </font color="#00008B">They will be so overjoyed that you are still alive that they will give you anything you want. And that would include letting you marry whoever you want<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> (excited) Oh yes, yes, yes. I see it now. You are a genius!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Yes, I can see it would probably work like that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">No guarantees mind but that is the best I can offer<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">I'll do it, Where's the potion?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Father Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Whoah there, slow down, this needs a bit more thought and working out properly<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Hello boys How are you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Father Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">Nursey, how lovely to see you<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> Lovely to see you too my dear<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Hello Nursey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Nice to see you here, can I get you a drink?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">That is kind of you Romeo, a small glass of porter if you would be so kind<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo: </font color="#00008B">Small glass pf porter please Friar<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Not often we see you here Nursey<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> I am not here often it is true. I have come this evening to ask a favour of my dear friend the Friar<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence.</font color="#00008B"> Anything for you my dear, how can I help you?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">It's a little tricky really and if her Ladyship finds out  about this I shall probably be sacked<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence. </font color="#00008B">Well we don't want to see that. I know these two lads well and I know they can be discreet<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Nothing we hear will be repeated<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio : </font color="#00008B">And I'll probably forget it anyway<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">So where do I start? I have been Juliet's nurse since she was a babe in arms and I just cannot bear to see her unhappy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">I do know how much you adore that girl.<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">The problem is, her Ladyship and her husband want Juliet to marry young Romeo here<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Romeo:</font color="#00008B"> Don't I know it<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> And I just wondered with all your learning and wisdom if you could find a way perhaps to help these to youngsters out. Try to find a way for them to avoid the marriage?<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Strange you should say that<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Father Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">We have just been talking about that very same situation, and I think I may have a solution. It may not work but could be worth a try<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">The poor dear is desperate, I am sure she will try anything<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Father Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> I have  special potion, called sleeper, that I want you to give to Juliet, and this is how it will work...........<p>

Scene Six. The next morning in Juliets bedroom<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Lady Capulet:</font color="#00008B"> Wakey wakey! Rise and shine. You should have been up hours ago (pause) Julia. Wake up my dear. You simply cannot lie there all day (Pause) Just look at all these clothes scattered all over the floor. Nurse must come and tidy up here. (pause) Julia, for goodness sake get up (Long pause) Julia, Julia wake up (in shocked voice) Oh no! Oh no no no!  (shouting) My lord, my Lord come here, come here quickly our daughter is dead! My darling - errr Julia I think - is not breathing. She is dead<p>

Scene Seven. The Tavern<p>

<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">(upset) I can't believe it. Romeo, gone!<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">(in tears) My poor darling Juliet, taken from us<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">He was the best friend a fellow could ever have and now he is no more<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">That poor child barely fifteen with all her life to live lying stiff and cold<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">Romeo wanted to run away, I should have let him and he would still be alive<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse: </font color="#00008B">Juliet was so fun, so full of life now she has no life<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Romeo Can never be replaced he was one lad in a million<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">It is sad. So very, very sad<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio:</font color="#00008B"> Sad? Sad? It is much more than sad, it is tragic. This whole thing is a tragedy<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Nurse:</font color="#00008B"> And I came to you because I thought your were a wise and learned man<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence:</font color="#00008B"> Even wise and learned men can make mistakes. I just got sleeper and cyanide confused<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Mercutio: </font color="#00008B">At least they won't have to marry<p>
<font color="#0000FF">Friar Lawrence: </font color="#00008B">So true. All's well that ends well.....<p>
